In working on the Trafikanten JSON API I needed to be able to convert from UTM coordinates, which is the native Trafikanten location mapping, to the more common format of latitude and longitude. After digging, reading, and experimenting, this is what we came up with.

I will add some unit tests and a project file ASAP.
